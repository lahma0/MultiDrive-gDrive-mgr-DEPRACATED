multidrive
==========

"MultiDrive" is a utility that allows you to manage multiple Google Drive accounts simultaneously. Features uploading, downloading, and drive-to-drive transfers. It is a project I started on, and never got around to releasing. I thought instead of leaving sitting on my hard drive, I would share it with others in case someone else needs this type of functionality.

NOTE: As I have found no secure way of storing my Google Client Secret within an open source application, you will have to provide your own. If you do not know how to obtain a Google Client ID/Secret, I will shortly post instructions below.
